# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project analyzes and detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset used is the popular **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**, which contains anonymized transaction data.

## 📊 Project Overview
- Visualized **class imbalance** between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to study fraud vs. non-fraud transaction patterns.  
- Applied **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization.  
- Built and evaluated classification models to detect fraudulent transactions.
